# ProductRecommendationSystem

This project is a Flask-based recommendation system that provides personalized product recommendations using a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF). The system processes user data, including browsing history, ratings, and product metadata, to generate recommendations. A TF-IDF vectorizer is used to compute content similarity between products, while user-product interaction data forms the basis for collaborative filtering. The hybrid model integrates CF and CBF scores, with additional real-time adjustments based on recently viewed products. Users can search for products, view recommendations on a user-friendly interface, and receive dynamic, personalized suggestions. The project integrates real-time product recommendations.
